# 📘 Project Overview

- In many social surveys, income related questions have high non-response rates. This project analyzes a data set from Northern Mozambique to explore which demographic and household characteristics predict income non-response. Understanding these factors can inform better survey design in developing countries.

# 🎯 Objectives

- Investigate demographic and infrastructure related predictors of income non-response
- Build logistic regression models, including interaction terms
- Evaluate models with AIC, BIC, Hosmer–Lemeshow test, and ROC-AUC score
- Compare models selected via statistical criteria and cross-validation

# 📦 Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Load data set and create new binary variables for later analysis
- Handle missing values
- Convert variables to factors
- Check whether data is imbalanced

```{r}
# Load data set
wtp <- read.csv("WTP.csv")

# Produce new variable to show if provide a numerical total income
wtp$INCOME_NONRESPONSE <- ifelse(is.na(wtp$TOTAL_INCOME),1,0)
head(wtp)

# Table of frequency of outcomes of 0 and 1
table(wtp$INCOME_NONRESPONSE)
```

```{r}
# Create subset of 9 variables only
wtp.reduced <- wtp[, c("TOWN", "SEX", "AGE", "EDUC", "HEAD", "PAY_WATER", "ELECTRIC", "TIME_LENGTH", "INCOME_NONRESPONSE")]

# Define special codes that refer to missing value and convert those to NA
missing.codes <- c(-1, 9998, 9999)
wtp.cleaned <- wtp.reduced %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ replace(., . %in% missing.codes, NA)))

# Create new data frame that remove missing data NA
wtp.complete <- na.omit(wtp.cleaned)
head(wtp.complete)

# Calculate the proportion of observations removed from original data set
removed.rows <- nrow(wtp) - nrow(wtp.complete)
proportion.removed <- round(removed.rows / nrow(wtp),3)
proportion.removed
```

```{r}
# Check variables current status and convert those needs to be factor
str(wtp.complete)

factor.vars <- c("TOWN", "SEX", "EDUC", "HEAD", "PAY_WATER", "ELECTRIC")
wtp.complete[factor.vars] <- lapply(wtp.complete[factor.vars], as.factor)
str(wtp.complete)
```

# 📝 note:

- The data set contained coded missing values which were converted to NA and removed out, a total about 8.4% of observations were removed. The data is imbalanced, so we would need be careful on the model evaluation metrics.

# 📝 note:

- According to the plot, we observed higher income non-response rates among households with electricity, not paying for water and among females.


# 🔍 Inferential analysis

- Fit baseline Logistic Regression model
- Model with interaction terms
- Carry out model comparison
- Carry out goodness-of-fit test 

```{r}
# Fit logistic regression model
model <- glm(INCOME_NONRESPONSE ~ TOWN + SEX + AGE + EDUC + HEAD + PAY_WATER + ELECTRIC + TIME_LENGTH, data = wtp.complete, family = "binomial")

# Calculate VIF to check the multicollinearity
model.vif <- vif(model)
vif.value <- round(model.vif, 3)
vif.value

# Get model summary to see what variable is significant 
summary(model)
```

```{r}
# Fit a model with interactions and produce summary
model.interactions <- glm(INCOME_NONRESPONSE ~ TOWN + SEX + AGE + EDUC + HEAD + PAY_WATER + ELECTRIC + TIME_LENGTH + SEX:PAY_WATER + SEX:ELECTRIC, data = wtp.complete, family = "binomial")
summary(model.interactions)
```

```{r}
# Carry out likelihood ratio test
model <- glm(INCOME_NONRESPONSE ~ SEX + AGE + EDUC + PAY_WATER + ELECTRIC, data = wtp.complete, family = "binomial")

model.interactions <- glm(INCOME_NONRESPONSE ~ SEX + AGE + EDUC + PAY_WATER + ELECTRIC + SEX:PAY_WATER + SEX:ELECTRIC, data = wtp.complete, family = "binomial")

pander(anova(model, model.interactions, test = "Chisq"))
```

```{r}
# performance Hosmer-Lemeshow test
hl.5 <- hoslem.test(wtp.complete$INCOME_NONRESPONSE,fitted(model.interactions), g=5)
hl.10 <- hoslem.test(wtp.complete$INCOME_NONRESPONSE,fitted(model.interactions), g=10)
hl.15 <- hoslem.test(wtp.complete$INCOME_NONRESPONSE,fitted(model.interactions), g=15)

# create summary table
hl.results <- data.frame(
  Groups = c(5,10,15),
  Chi_Squared = c(hl.5$statistic, hl.10$statistic, hl.15$statistic),
  DF = c(hl.5$parameter, hl.10$parameter, hl.15$parameter),
  P_value = c(hl.5$p.value, hl.10$p.value, hl.15$p.value)
)

hl.results
```

# 📝 note:

- Electricity and Pay_for_water are significant predictors. Multicollinearity is low (VIF < 5).
- The interaction between gender and both PAY_WATER and ELECTRIC is significant, suggesting different response behaviors by gender.
- The interaction model significantly improves fit (p = 0.0074).
- Hosmer–Lemeshow test shows no evidence of poor fit (p > 0.05).

# 📝 note:

- AIC selects HEAD + PAY_WATER + ELECTRIC; BIC selects a simpler model excluding HEAD.
- The optimal model based on accuracy including AGE + PAY_WATER + ELECTRIC + TIME_LENGTH and based on AUC including HEAD + PAY_WATER + ELECTRIC + TIME_LENGTH.
- Since our goal is prediction, we would prefer the out-of-sample performance metric - Accuracy and AUC, as they can tell how well the model will work on future data.
- AUC and Accuracy differ only on whether to include HEAD or AGE, but since AIC including HEAD, we would consider the final model as including HEAD + PAY_WATER + ELECTRIC +TIME_LENGTH.
